# RPG v5
I try to build a text RPG, I go on break, repeat

This is *just* a learning project for me to understand OOP and python properly, its not like an
official thing lmao

this project is still under development because I'm lazy,
I'm most likely either on break from completing this or working hard on it.

next thing I intend to work on:
```
> gotta make the thing flexible in such a way that I can easily add stuff to it and change interfaces without ever changing the engine
```

last thing I got fully done:
```
> inventory stack mechanics
```
