# RPG v6
So here we are again
I just gave up on v5 code because it looked too messy,
now im starting from scratch.

This is *just* a learning project for me to understand OOP and python properly, its not like an
official thing lmao

this project is still under development because I'm lazy,
I'm most likely either on break from completing this or working hard on it.

next thing I intend to work on:
```
> clean up the stuff im reusing from v5 and proceed to actually making the thing
```

last thing I got fully done:
```
> cleaned up game.py
```
